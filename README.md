# Map Navigator Project

The Map Navigator project implements a navigation system using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two locations on a map. This project is implemented in C++ and focuses on optimizing routes based on factors like distance and traffic.

## Project Overview

The project uses Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path in a graph representation of a map. It considers nodes as locations and edges as roads, with weights representing distances or travel times.

### Features

- **Graph Representation:** Represents the map as a graph using adjacency lists or matrices.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path from a source location to a destination.
- **Optimization:** Considers factors like distance, traffic conditions (represented by edge weights), and road types to determine the optimal route.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/map-navigator.git
   cd map-navigator
